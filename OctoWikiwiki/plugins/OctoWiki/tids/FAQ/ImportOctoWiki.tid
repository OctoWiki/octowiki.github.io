title: F.A.Q. Can I have my own OctoWiki or import it into my personal wiki ?
tags: $:/OTW/FAQ

The answer to the first question is yes. You can clone the repository, fork it, download the sources or just
download the OctoWiki `.html` file. However your personal copies will only work with the `personal token` authorization mechanism.

Regarding the second question, "//can I import OctoWiki as a plugin to my personal wiki?//" the answer is ''NO''. <br>
OctoWiki is designed as an edition and it ''is not intended to persist it's changes in the wiki it lives in''.
OctoWiki relies on some heavy intrusive customizations, and it will probably not play well wit most wikis, which are, at the end, very personal files.
